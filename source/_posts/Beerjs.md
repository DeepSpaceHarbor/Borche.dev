Last week I was on the stage at [BeerJS Скопје](https://beerjs.mk/announcements/033-vol4-announcement/), talking about test automation for frontend developers.

The conversation started with "It works on my computer, why do I need a test?" and it went all the way down to setting goals, test case design, collaboration with the QA team, and so on. The audience had many insightful questions, all worthy of separate deep-dive presentations.

Here's the video from the event:
