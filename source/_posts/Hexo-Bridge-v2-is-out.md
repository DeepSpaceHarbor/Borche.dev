Hey friends, exciting news! [Hexo-Bridge](https://github.com/DeepSpaceHarbor/hexo-bridge) just dropped its v2.0. This new version comes with this new [code mirror](https://codemirror.net/) editor that makes content creation a breeze, plus there's a slick dark mode for the night owls. And here's the cool part: it's got Grammarly integration built right in! So, no more cringe-worthy typos and grammar blunders. Bugs have been squashed, performance has been improved. Everything is just better, better, and better.
